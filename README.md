# GSC for VS Code

This neat little extension allows you to code your .gsc scripts in VS Code with full support for Black Ops III. 

## Getting Started

The extension also includes quite a lot of code snippets and some other features.

### Prerequisites

Incase you haven't downloaded Black Ops III Mod Tools, here's a short guide on how to get them:
1. Open up Steam
2. Hove over 'Library' and select the 'Tools' option
3. Start looking for 'Call of Duty: Black Ops III - Mod Tools'
4. And Simply double-click it

### Before you start coding

Once you've downloaded the necessities, I suggest you download [this zip file](https://github.com/GodAspire/bo3.gsc/raw/master/Black%20Ops%203.rar "Black Ops III - Doc"), where you will find Treyarch's documentation and most of their game scripts. There will also be an example mod.

When that's done you need to open the windows explorer and go to:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III
```

And just create a new folder called 'mods'. Then unpack the downloaded .zip file and place the 'mp_startup_mod' folder inside the 'mods' folder.

## Running the tests

Open the 'mp_startup_mod' folder, go to scripts\mp\gametypes and open the file '_clientids.gsc'.


### Launching Mod Tools

Navigate to your main Black Ops III folder and launch 'modtools_launcher.bat'. And select the following items:

Click on Build and wait while the game is building your mod. After that start Black Ops 3 and click on 'Mods'. Now select 'mp_startup_mod' and enjoy your time coding .gsc
